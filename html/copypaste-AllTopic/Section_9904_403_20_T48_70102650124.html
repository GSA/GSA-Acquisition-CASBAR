         <p class="p List1">(a) The purpose of this Cost Accounting Standard is to establish criteria for allocation of the expenses of a home office to the segments of the organization based on the beneficial or causal relationship between such expenses and the receiving segments. It provides for:
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(1) Identification of expenses for direct allocation to segments to the maximum extent practical; 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(2) Accumulation of significant nondirectly allocated expenses into logical and relatively homogeneous pools to be allocated on bases reflecting the relationship of the expenses to the segments concerned; and 
</p>
         <p class="p List2">(3) Allocation of any remaining or residual home office expenses to all segments. 
</p>
         <p class="p FP">Appropriate implementation of this Standard will limit the amount of home office expenses classified as residual to the expenses of managing the organization as a whole. 
</p>
         <p class="p List1">(b) This Standard does not cover the reallocation of a segment's share of home office expenses to contracts and other cost objectives.
