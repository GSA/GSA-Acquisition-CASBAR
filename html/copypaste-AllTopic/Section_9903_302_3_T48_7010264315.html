The contractor's business changes substantially such that there are significant new projects which have only insignificant quantities of material.
(ii) After change: After the addition of the new work, an evaluation of the changed circumstances reveals that the continued use of a total cost input base would result in a significant distortion in the allocation of the G&amp;A expense pool in relation to the benefits received. To remain in compliance with Standard 410, the contractor alters his G&amp;A allocation base from a total cost input base to a value added base.
